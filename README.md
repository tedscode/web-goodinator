# Comic Injector
A wonderful Chrome Extension that uses revolutionary technology to change every text on the internet to the best font.

## Installation
- [Download and unzip the source code.](https://github.com/ts7n/comic-injector/archive/master.zip) [\[?\]](#folder-notice)
- Move the unzipped folder to a place where you won't delete or move it.
- Open chrome://extensions
- Enable "Developer mode"
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Upload the folder.
- You're done!

### Folder Notice
Because this extension is being directly loaded from a folder on your computer, if that folder is moved/deleted, the extension will break. If the folder must be moved/deleted, you can uninstall and then reinstall the extension.

## Font
You need the Comic Sans MS font installed to use this. It probably comes pre-installed on your device.
